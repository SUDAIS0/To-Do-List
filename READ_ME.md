# TO-DO List Management System in C++

## Executive Summary
The TO-DO List Management System is a simple application implemented in C++ using a doubly linked list. It allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by providing functionalities to add, remove, and display tasks. The system supports various operations, including task prioritization and position-specific task manipulation.

## Code Overview
The provided C++ code implements a TO-DO list using a doubly linked list. Users can add tasks to the beginning, end, or middle of the list, and remove tasks from specified positions. The code also includes functionality to sort tasks based on user preference.

## Code Structure
### Node Class
- Represents a node in the doubly linked list.
- Contains string data (`task`), and pointers to the previous and next nodes.

### dbLinkList Class
- Manages the doubly linked list.
- Functions include:
  - `pushHead(task)`: Adds a task to the head of the list.
  - `pushTail(task)`: Adds a task to the tail of the list.
  - `pushMid(position, task)`: Inserts a task at a specified position.
  - `popHead()`: Removes the task at the head of the list.
  - `popTail()`: Removes the task at the tail of the list.
  - `popMid(position)`: Removes a task from a specified position.
  - `display()`: Displays all tasks in the list.
  - `gettingTask(position)`: Retrieves and removes a task from a specified position.

### Main Function
- Implements a menu-driven interface for user interaction.
- Users can add tasks, remove tasks, display the list, and access additional options for task manipulation.
- Includes input validation for user commands and positions.

## User Interface
- The main menu provides options to insert tasks, delete tasks, display the list, and access further options.
- The further options menu allows users to perform specific operations such as adding tasks at the head, tail, or middle, removing tasks from specific positions, sorting tasks, and clearing the list.

## Key Features
1. **Task Management**: Allows users to add, remove, and display tasks.
2. **Task Prioritization**: Users can insert tasks at specific positions.
3. **Task Sorting**: Users can sort tasks by specifying their positions.
4. **Menu-Driven Interface**: Provides an interactive menu for easy task management.

## Sample Usage
1. **Add a Task**:
   - User selects the option to add a task and enters the task description.
2. **Remove a Task**:
   - User selects the option to remove a task from the head, tail, or a specific position.
3. **Display the List**:
   - User selects the option to display all tasks currently in the list.
4. **Advanced Options**:
   - User can access additional options to insert tasks at specific positions, sort tasks, and clear the list.

## Suggestions and Improvements (Needs to be done yet)
1. **Input Validation**: Enhance input validation to handle unexpected user inputs and prevent potential errors or crashes.
2. **Error Handling**: Improve error messages to provide more context and guide the user effectively.
3. **Memory Management**: Ensure proper memory management to avoid memory leaks.
4. **User Interface**: Refine the user interface for better clarity and user experience.
5. **Encapsulation**: Make data members private and provide public methods for accessing and modifying them.

## Conclusion
The TO-DO List Management System in C++ provides basic functionalities for managing tasks using a doubly linked list. While the current implementation meets the fundamental requirements, there is room for improvement in terms of input validation, error handling, memory management, and user interface design to enhance the overall robustness and usability of the application.
